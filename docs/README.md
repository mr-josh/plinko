# Template
`For: Vite + TS + p5 + matter-js`

This is an extension to the [Tauri + Vite + TS](https://github.com/tmplts/tauri-vite-ts-www) template.

> **Note:** Basic bindings for `p5 + matter-js` are done through a single `physics.ts` file. However you could easily replace them with your own, or use another module.
